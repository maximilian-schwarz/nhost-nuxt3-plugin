# serverNhostClient

This function is working similary as the [useNhostClient](/usage/vue-composables/usenhostclient) composable but is designed to be used in server routes.<br>
Define your server route and just import the `serverNhostClient` from `@nhost/server`.

```ts [server/api/customers.ts]
import { serverNhostClient } from '@nhost/server'

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const client = await serverNhostClient(event)
  
  const CUSTOMERS = gql`
    query {
      customers {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  `
  
  const { data, error } = await client.graphql.request(CUSTOMERS)
  
  return { customers: data }
})
```

Then call your API route from any vue file:

```vue [app.vue]
<script setup>
  const fetchCustomer = async () => {
    const { customers } = await $fetch('/api/customers')
  }
</script>
```

Be careful, if you want to call this route on SSR, please read this [section](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/data-fetching/#isomorphic-fetch-and-fetch), you must send your browser cookies including your nhost token.

```vue [app.vue]
<script setup>
  const { data: { customers }} = await useFetch('/api/customers', {
    headers: useRequestHeaders(['cookie'])
  })
</script>
```
