# serverNhostAdminSecret 
This function is designed to work only in [server routes](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server/), there is no vue composable equivalent.<br>
It works similary as the serverNhostClient but it provides a client with admin rights that can bypass "admin mode".

::alert{type="info"}
The client is initialized with the NHOST_ADMIN_SECRET you must have in your .env file. Checkout the doc if you want to know more about [admin secret](https://docs.nhost.io/reference/javascript/storage/set-admin-secret).
::

Define your server route and just import the `serverNhostAdminSecret` from `@nhost/server`.
server/api/customers-sensitive.ts
```ts [server/api/customers.ts]
import { serverNhostAdminSecret } from '@nhost/server'

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const client = await serverNhostAdminSecret(event)
  
  const CUSTOMERS = gql`
    query {
      customers {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  `
  
  const { data, error } = await client.graphql.request(CUSTOMERS)
  
  return { customers: data }
})
```

Then call your API route from any vue file:

```vue [app.vue]
<script setup>
const fetchSensitiveData = async () => {
  const { customers } = await useFetch('/api/customers-sensitive')
}
</script>
```
